# Kensaku launch kit (1.0.7)

Everything needed to announce the app. Tone rules: concrete over adjectives,
honest limits included, every post ends with a question or an ask for feedback.
Never crosspost the same day to overlapping audiences.

---

## 1. Reddit

### Titles (ranked)

1. `You can't Ctrl+F a screenshot. Now you can.`
2. `I stopped naming files and started searching what's inside them`
3. `Spotlight for Windows — and it reads inside your screenshots (free, MIT)`

Title 1 for r/SideProject and r/productivity (curiosity + familiar pain).
Title 3 for r/windowsapps (Mac-envy phrase converts there). Title 2 is the
safe personal-story fallback anywhere.

### Body (all subs except r/opensource)

```
I could never find my own screenshots. I knew the error said "CUDA out of
memory". I knew I screenshotted it. I did not know it was called
"Screenshot 2026-07-14 094231.png".

So I built Kensaku (検索 = search). It indexes your files and reads inside
them — PDFs, DOCX, code, logs, and with OCR, the actual text in your
screenshots. It also finds by meaning: "the PDF about database indexing"
locates notes-final-2.pdf. And it parses "screenshots from last week".

  • 100% local. No account, no telemetry, nothing to the cloud.
  • Alt+Space to summon. ~20 MB of RAM idling in the tray. 9 MB installer.
  • Free and open source, MIT: github.com/yjid/kensaku
  • Bonus: Claude or Cursor can search the same index over MCP, read-only.

Windows is the build I've beaten on most; macOS and Linux come straight
from CI and need real-world testing — that's exactly the feedback I'm
here for.

What's the first thing you'd search for?
```

### r/opensource variant

Same body, plus this line before the final question:

```
License: MIT. Stack: Rust + Tauri, SQLite (WAL) as durable truth, Tantivy
for full text, model2vec static embeddings for semantic search. Docs live
in /docs — ARCHITECTURE.md is the honest map. Extractors are a documented
extension point (docs/EXTRACTORS.md) if you want to teach it a new format.
```

### Attach

`assets/hero.png` to every Reddit post (visual ≈ 2× engagement).

### Per-sub first comment (post it yourself immediately after submitting)

- r/SideProject: "The single most requested thing so far was 'search my
  screenshots' — OCR runs with Tesseract by default, and Settings has an
  optional PP-OCRv6 pack for handwriting-ish and low-quality captures."
- r/productivity: "The workflow trick: don't organize. Search 'invoice
  modified:30d' beats the folder you were going to create."
- r/windowsapps: "Alt+Space is the default summon (rebindable in Settings).
  It starts hidden in the tray and trims to ~20 MB while idle."
- r/opensource: "Good first issues are labeled in the tracker; extractors
  and agent tooling are the two areas where outside PRs land fastest."

## 2. Show HN

### Title (mechanism-forward, zero hype — HN rule)

```
Show HN: Kensaku – local file search that reads inside your screenshots
```

### Body (~110 words)

```
Kensaku (検索) is local-first file search and a launcher for
Windows/macOS/Linux. It indexes file names (~1ms across 100k files,
benchmarks with methodology in the repo), full text in PDFs/DOCX/PPTX and
code, OCR'd text inside screenshots via Tesseract or an optional
PP-OCRv6 pack, and semantic matches — "the PDF about database indexing"
finds notes-final-2.pdf. No cloud, no account, MIT.

I built it because I kept losing screenshots of errors I could describe
but not name. Indexing is a single pass — each file feeds both the name
and text indexes once — with incremental updates on change.

Honest limits: builds are unsigned, no auto-updater yet, thumbnails are
images-only. Windows is the most-tested build; macOS/Linux feedback is
the thing I want most: github.com/yjid/kensaku
```

### Author first comment (post immediately — the technical deep-dive)

```
Author here. Architecture notes for the technically curious (full map in
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md):

- SQLite with WAL is the durable truth; an in-memory snapshot built at
  startup serves queries and is mutated incrementally. Chose this over a
  custom mmap format for crash safety and free migrations; the mmap
  Everything-style format is the documented next step if cold load ever
  exceeds 400ms at 1M files.
- Name search is served from the in-memory tier (2-4ms budget). Full text
  is Tantivy (batched). We benchmarked SQLite F5 trigram as a replacement
  and rejected it: 918 MB and 258ms broad BM25 vs Tantivy's numbers in
  docs/BENCHMARKS.md.
- Semantic tier: model2vec static embeddings (potion-base-8M, 256-dim,
  i8-quantized, ~7.7MB table). No ONNX and no neural graph at query time —
  tokenize, table lookup, weighted mean, normalize, ~50µs/query, ~92% of
  MiniLM's MTEB average. An optional 40MB pack (fastembed + bge-small) is
  available for higher quality.
- OCR: Tesseract by default; optional PP-OCRv6 via onnxruntime
  (load-dynamic — the static ORT build requires AVX2 and SIGILLs older
  CPUs).
- The launcher destroys its webview when hidden and rebuilds on summon;
  idle state is ~20MB private on Windows with a 24.5k-file index loaded.
- Agent access is read-only over MCP/loopback HTTP, budgeted in size,
  content returned as data never instructions.

Known tradeoffs we argued about: unsigned binaries (signing costs are
real for an independent app), no auto-updater yet, thumbnails image-only
for now. What would you want an extractor for next?
```

## 3. X / Twitter

### Main post

```
You can't Ctrl+F a screenshot.

So we made Kensaku — local file search that reads inside your files:
PDFs, code, logs, and the text in your screenshots.

Describe it: "the PDF about database indexing". It finds notes-final-2.pdf.

100% local. Free, MIT.
github.com/yjid/kensaku
```

### Follow-up (reply to own post)

```
Alt+Space to summon, type, Enter. 9 MB installer, ~20 MB idle in the
tray. Your AI agent can search the same index over MCP — read-only,
nothing leaves the machine.
```

## 4. Playbook

| When | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Day 1, 8–11am ET | r/SideProject | Title 1, hero image attached, own first comment |
| Day 1 or 2, 7–10am ET | Show HN | Tue–Thu only. First comment immediately, answer everything for 24h |
| Day 3 | r/opensource | Title 2 + license/stack line, contribution-focused first comment |
| Day 4 | r/productivity, r/windowsapps | Crosspost variants, own per-sub comments |
| Same days | X | Main post morning ET, follow-up reply after 4–6h |

Rules that matter more than copy:

1. **Reply speed is the growth engine.** A bug reported in comments and
   fixed with a pushed commit the same day outperforms any headline.
2. **Never argue feature gaps.** Quote the honest-limits paragraph.
3. **One metric to watch:** downloads on the release page per 1,000 views.
   If it's low, the README hero is the thing to fix, not the posts.
4. **If HN flags the domain** (new domain, low karma), submit the deep
   GitHub URL, not the marketing landing page.
5. Update the [latest release](https://github.com/yjid/kensaku/releases/latest)
   notes only via new releases — never edit a published release silently.

## 5. Product Hunt

**Tagline (≤60 chars) — pick one, test in A/B:**

1. `Ctrl+F for your screenshots` ← the one to lead with
2. `Find files by what's inside them, not their names`
3. `The file search that reads your screenshots`

**Description (~260 chars):**

```
Kensaku indexes your files and reads inside them — PDFs, code, logs, and the
text in your screenshots. Find by meaning ("the PDF about database
indexing"), parse "screenshots from last week". 100% local, free, MIT.
Your AI agent can search it too (MCP).
```

**Topics to tag:** Productivity, Developer Tools, Open Source, Privacy, AI

**Maker first comment (post the second the listing goes live):**

```
Hey PH 👋 Maker here.

I built Kensaku because I could never find my own screenshots. I knew the
error said "CUDA out of memory", I knew I'd screenshotted it, and I had no
idea it was called "Screenshot 2026-07-14 094231.png".

So it reads the pixels. OCR, built in. Plus meaning-based search, natural
language time filters, and MCP so your AI agent can search the same index
read-only. Nothing leaves the machine. MIT.

Honest limits: unsigned builds, no auto-updater yet, Windows is the
most-tested platform. macOS/Linux come from CI and need real-world
testing — that's the feedback I'm here for. What would you search for first?
```

**Rules that matter on PH:** launch at 00:01 PT (Tuesday–Thursday), the maker
comment must be the first comment, and reply to every comment in the first
24h. A short demo GIF in the gallery outperforms any screenshot.

## 6. Indie Hackers

**Title:** `I'm launching Kensaku — local file search that reads your screenshots`

**Post:**

```
I'm launching Kensaku (検索 = search) today.

I built it because I kept losing screenshots of errors I could describe but
not name. It indexes your files and reads inside them — PDFs, code, logs,
and the text in screenshots via OCR. It also finds by meaning and parses
things like "screenshots from last week".

Numbers that matter to me right now: ~20 MB idle in the tray, 9 MB
installer, 1.3 ms name search across 100k files, 0 bytes to the cloud.
MIT, free.

I'm not charging for it. The goal is to build the launcher people
actually want to use, then figure out the business. macOS and Linux come
from CI and need real-world testing — if you're on either, I'd love a
test report.

What's the first thing you'd search for?
```

## 7. LinkedIn

**Post (professional, first-person, no emoji spam):**

```
I shipped Kensaku today — a local file search that reads inside your files.

The itch: I could never find my own screenshots. I knew the error said
"CUDA out of memory", I knew I'd captured it, and I had no idea what I'd
named the file.

So I built one that reads the pixels. OCR is built in, along with full
text search across PDFs/DOCX/code, meaning-based matches, and natural
language time filters ("screenshots from last week"). Everything stays on
your machine — no account, no telemetry, no cloud.

Stack: Rust, Tauri 2, SQLite + Tantivy, model2vec for semantic search.
MIT licensed, free. Windows/macOS/Linux.

If you try it and it breaks, tell me — that's the most useful thing
right now: github.com/yjid/kensaku
```

## 9. Dev.to / Hashnode (long-form, SEO)

**Title:** `How I built a local file search that reads inside your screenshots (Rust + Tauri)`

**Outline (write it as a build log, not a press release):**

1. The itch — the screenshot problem, with the concrete example
2. Why "filename search" tools leave money on the table
3. The architecture: SQLite WAL as durable truth, in-memory snapshot, Tantivy
   for text, model2vec for meaning, Tesseract + PP-OCRv6 for pixels
4. The hard parts: webview destruction on hide, OCR budgeting, keeping memory
   flat on large folders, the theme bug that wouldn't die
5. Benchmarks with methodology (link docs/BENCHMARKS.md)
6. What's next — link the roadmap Discussions
7. CTA: try it, star it, tell me what breaks

## 10. Demo assets (do these before posting anything)

This is the highest-ROI 30 minutes of the whole launch. Posts with a short
demo clip outperform text-only posts by a wide margin on every platform.

- [ ] **10–15s screen recording, no audio:** Alt+Space → type "cuda out of
      memory" → results appear → Enter opens the screenshot. One take.
      Save as `demo.gif` (≤8 MB for GitHub) and an MP4 for PH/X.
- [x] **Static hero screenshot:** `assets/hero.png`, a real 920x640
      capture of 1.0.8 searching "invoice", matching inside a PDF, a
      screenshot, a spreadsheet and a note. Light twin in
      `assets/search-light.png`.
- [ ] **Social preview:** upload `assets/social-preview.png` in repo
      Settings → Social preview (GitHub doesn't allow this via API).
- [ ] **One-liner for bios:** "I build Kensaku — local search that reads
      inside your files. github.com/yjid/kensaku"
